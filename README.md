## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**

   - Ensure you have sufficient quota

2. **Image Upload Issues**
   - Check file size (max 10MB recommended)
   - Ensure file format is supported (JPG, PNG, GIF)
   - Try a different image

3. **Analysis Fails**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API key is set and valid
   - Try with a clearer image

4. **Image Generation Issues**
   - Ensure you have completed photo analysis first
   - Check that your API key has image generation permissions
   - Try more specific model descriptions
   - Be patient - generation can take 30-60 seconds
   - If generation fails, try the "Generate Again" button

5. **Generated Image Quality**
   - Results may vary depending on the original image
   - More detailed descriptions usually yield better results
   - The AI may not perfectly preserve all original elements
   - This is a beta feature and results will improve over time
